## [Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)

1. split the UI into independent and reusable pieces.
2. Custom, reusable HTML elements.
3. data is stored and handled, using state and props

### JSX 
> Js + XML, react uses JSX for template whick looks like Html but are XML and gets tranformed into javaScript after rendering.
1. JSX defines which HTML code React should render to the real DOM in the end.
2. Follows camelin format. eg: `onClick`, not `onclick`
3. `class` is reserved keyword hence uses `className`.
4. `return (<div> ... </div>);` - only one root element.
5. `<react1> abc </react1>` : `abc` will be accessible in `props.children`
6. state and props are special properties of Component Class and their values get changed then react will rerender Virtual DOM.

### Type
#### Functional components 
- Also referred to as "presentational", "dumb" or "stateless" components.
- `const cmp = () => { return <div>some JSX</div> }`
- purpose : to rendered dynamic content and no does maintain state.

#### class-based components 
- Also referred to as "containers", "smart" or "stateful" components
- `class Cmp extends Component { render () { return <div>some JSX</div> } } `
- can be stateless or stateful.

***
### Rendering:
1. `setState()` is called, it marks the component as dirty.
2. `render()` method is called and returns a new `virtual DOM structure` of the component.
3. React changes `real DOM nodes` only if there is difference in Virtual DOM.

### Component communications
1. [state and props](https://github.com/lekhrajdinkar/ReactJS16/blob/master/proj-1/NOTES/002_state_and_props.md)

2. `parent to child` --> Pass down properties and object-references to child component from parent. Child will acces it from its props -`this.props` (Props are Read-Only).

3. `child to parent` -->`lift up state` : Pass down method reference to child component from parent and event in child to manipulate state in Parent.
 > 1. Define js method and assign to reference - `event1_method`

 > 2. Pass down reference as props to child comp - `<User>` here.

 > 3. inside User Comp : <input type="text" onChange={props.twoWayBind}/>

 > - `onChange` accepts callback method which has to be called whenever event triggered. `event1_method = (event) => {...} ` of parent comp will be callback method here which accepts event data coming from child component - User here.

 > 4. `event.target.value` -->

4. Among siblings --> lift up state uptocommon ancestor from Child-1 to parent. pass down state via props to child-2 from parent. child-1 and child-2 are sibling here.
