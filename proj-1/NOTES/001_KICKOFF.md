1. React really is just a library(not framework) for creating components in its core.
2. could be depicted as a component tree - having one root component ("App") and then an potentially infinite amount of nested child components.
3. open-source project created by Facebook.
4. Built with ES6 (next Gen JS, 2015, lots of new prgming construct)
